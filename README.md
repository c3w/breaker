BREAKER c3w@juicypop.net

	NEW!! Now with OSX click-able launchers.  Look for more OSX integration in future versions

	// Log smoke and lunch breaks to ~/.breakerlog

	// lauches screen saver and starts counting

	// NOW auto exits when ScreenSaverEngine stops

	// symlink smoke and lunch to breaker to control its logging behaivior
	// or run `breaker` for a generic break
	// e.g ln -s ~/bin/breaker ~/bin/smoke
